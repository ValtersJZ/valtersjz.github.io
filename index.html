    <h1>Hi</h1>
    <p>
        I'm a dreamer, I'm a pressure resistant fighter who aspires to
        invent the future. I can effectively work nonstop for days, weeks,
        and months when I feel adrenaline in my blood. My current
        interests are neural network system design as information circuits,
        deep reinforcement learning, and building invariances into neural
        networks.
    </p>
    <p>
        Formally I have a broad generalist background in electrical
        engineering and machine learning. I learn most through self study.
        I understand relationships and interaction between things and dont
        memorize to a fault. I love reasoning, thinking, predicting and
        explaining my thoughts in detail. I cannot stop thinking of new
        ideas. I have been interested in and learning about startups,
        finance and how the world works for more than a decade. I won't 
        list all my interests here.
    </p>

    <p>
        I'm currently working on 2 projects - unfortunately I won't share
        them with you now.
        1. Top secret.
        2. Secret.
    </p>

    <p>
        Sometimes I fuck up, but I get back up lit with strong internal drive
        releasing this potential energy like a controlled explosion. My road to
        building cool stuff isn't linear.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Feel free to get in touch, I'm sure you can find a way.
    </p>

    <p>
        The purpose of this website is dubious, but probably I'll publish some
        less secret short essays, thoughts and ideas. Why? For kicks and glory.
