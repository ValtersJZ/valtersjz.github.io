    <h1>Hi</h1>
    <p>
        I'm a dreamer, who wants to invent the future. I can effectively
        work nonstop for days, weeks, and months when I feel adrenaline
        in blood. My current interests are neural network system design as
        information circuits, deep reinforcement learning, building
        invariances into neural networks.
    </p>
    <p>
        Formally I have a broad generalist background in electrical
        engineering and machine learning. I learn most through self study.
        I understand relationships and interaction between things and dont
        memorize to a fault. I love reasoning, thinking, predicting and
        explaining my thoughts in detail. I cannot stop thinking of new
        ideas. I have been interested in and learning about startups,
        finance and how the world works for more than a decade. I wont 
        list all my interests here.
    </p>

    <p>
        I'm currently working on 2 projects - unfortunately I wont share them with you now.
        1. Top secret.
        2. Secret.
    </p>

    <p>
        Feel free to get in touch, I'm sure you can find a way.
